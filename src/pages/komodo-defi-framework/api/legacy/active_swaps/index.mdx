# active\_swaps

The `active_swaps` method returns all the swaps that are currently running on the Komodo DeFi Framework API node.

<Note>
  This method has been deprecated in favor of [active\_swaps v2](/komodo-defi-framework/api/v20/swaps_and_orders/active_swaps/). The legacy version does not include v2 (Trading Protocol Upgrade) swap statuses in responses (it only returns uuids for these).
